# Javascrpt is the langauge of behavior.

One might say that js is what makes webpages come alive. 
Interactions between the user and the webpage are js, e-commerce would not be possible without js.
 ## Javascript is coded using scripts.
 * Scripts are logical and sometimes mathmatical sequences.
 * similar to css, a technique is to create a separate js file, and then link that to the indel.html file.
