# These are the notes I'm  from HTML review with Brad

## HTML overview

  1. html describes the basic structure of webpages.
  2. It is the primary language maybe thinking of it as the outline to webpage and content language.
  3. html is not how one makes the page pretty nor interactive, CSS does the pretty, js does the interaction

* '!DOCTYPE html' or .html determines the type of file, index.html is the primary file name for a file.
* </tag> closing tag
* Together, they re an element, which is the basic building 'unit' in html. The elements are all nested, like the Russian stacking dolls.
* the href is a hyperlink reference or link.
* Inside of the tags are attributes.
  * Attributes are made up by an attribute name and an attribute value. Below is an example.
    * lang="en-us" prior to the equal sign is the attibute name, the en-us in quotes is the value.

<img is for images, but it requires a source code src-"https://codefellows.com" alt="description of link--so this is codefellows homepage">
