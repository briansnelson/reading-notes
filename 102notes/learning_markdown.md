* Learning MarkDown

### Markdown
Markdown is shorthand coding for git. **Here** are a *few* examples of how **Markdown** makes coding easier:
1. Making numbered lists
2. Making font changes like bold or italics with code instead of using buttons
3. inserting links, images. 
- unordered lists are *IMHO* preferred to numbered or ordered lists most of the time
- Something that is not intuitive, but easily learned is that **SPACES MATTER** while coding, even in Markdown
- I might prefer unordered lists from the 27 years of indoctrination in the Army.

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
