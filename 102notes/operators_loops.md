### Operators and Loops
1. A while Loop: 
    1. Enter the while loop
    2. Test Expression
    3. If true then
    4. Body of while
    5. Return to test expression
    An example of a username password , keeps returning to login to retry password
2. A for Loop
    1. Initialization
    2. Condition
    3. if true
    4. loop body
    5. update
    'for (var i = 0; i <= 12; i = i +1) {
        console.log(i * 8);
    }
3. This is beginning to look much more like math. 

## Operators
These are not what a military person thinks of when hearing or saying operators. 
Operators evaluate a situation. 
1. Comparison Operators
* == is equal to
* != is not equal to
* === strict equal to
* !== strict not equal to
* > greater than
* < less than
* >= greater than or equal to 
* <= less than or equal to>

The comparison operator need situations to evaluate--these are called operands 
Here is an example: (score >= pass)

2. Logical Operators
Logical operators allow to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
* && is logial and-- an example is (2 < 5) && (3 >= 2)
* || logical or - easist way to get to true, stops at the first true (2 < 5 || (2 < 1)
* ! logical not--to be honest I don't really understand why this exists. It flips the logic
