# Functions are a way to wrap scripts into one piece of code. 
* clean way to add functionality to the site. 
Js scripts usually placed within body, but at the end. Page needs to read html and css prior to js 
* Expressions:evaluates into a single value. 
    * Two types of expressions
    1. expressions that assign a value to a variable: example is color-brown. 'var color = brown';
        * end the line of code with semi-colon, simiar to css ..i think anyway...
    2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value: var area = 3 * 4;
        * the value of the area above is now 12

* Operators-again, not like SOF types, all inked and bearded, but logical and arithmetic.
    1. assignment operators-assign a value to a variable; color = brown
    2. arirthmetic operators-perform basic math: area = 2 * 3; the asteric is multiplicaiton in js
    3. string operators: combines two strings: greeting = 'hi' + 'Jack';
    4. Comparison operators: compares two values and returns true or false: buy = 3 > 5;
    5. logical operators: combines expressions and return true or false: buy = ( 5> 3) && ( 2<4 ); 

This is where stuff starts to get funky.
