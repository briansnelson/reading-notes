# How Computers Work
This was a series of videos explaining the basic overview of computers.
Some pretty interesting stuff. 
1. What Makes a Computer a Computer?
    * 4 primary functions:
        * input
        * Store
        * Process
        * Output
2. Binary & Data
* This was the most interesting video, maybe because I had totally forgotten the binary number system
* Binary is: 1 or 0, on or off, true or false
    * this comprises a bit
* The number of inputs is dependent upon the number of wires. 
    * 8 wires = 256 possible outputs
    * 32 wires = over 4 billion!
* This video explained how text, sound, and video into numbers. Super fascinating
3. Circuits & Logic
This was also a pretty intersting video, while they didn't mention it, but
I finally began to understand Moore's Law. The smaller things are, the faster the data goes, the more data can be processed. 
4. CPU, Memory, Input/Output
* Had an *Amazon* programmer who showed us her dog
5. Hardware & Softward
* This is where we come in...coding.
