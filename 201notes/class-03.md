# Day 3 Reading HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, & CSS Box Model

## Lists from Chapter 3 of Duckett's HTML/CSS book

### Lists for HTML are in three types

1. *Ordered lists* of which this happens to be one, it is numbered
2. *Unordered lists* which begin with a bullet point
3. *Definition lists* are sets of terms along with definitions.

**Another way to describe the same lists are:**

- Numbered lists
- bullet lists
- definitions

Here I'm going to try to used a code block so I can show what I mean by using these particular tags in HTML.

```<ol> is an ordered or numbered list
```<ul> is an unordered list or bullet list
```<li> is how you code the specific lists, the ol and ul are opening and closing tags for the previous lists. Both ordered and unordered us ```<li>
```<dl> is the opening tag for definitions ```<dt> contains the term and ```<dd> contains the definition.```
