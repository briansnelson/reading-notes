# Prework for Code 201 HTML

## HTML overview

  1. html describes the basic structure of webpages.
  2. It is the primary language maybe thinking of it as the outline to webpage and content language.
  3. html is not how one makes the page pretty nor interactive, CSS does the pretty, js does the interaction

* '!DOCTYPE html' or .html determines the type of file, index.html is the primary file name for a file.
* </tag> closing tag
* Together, they re an element, which is the basic building 'unit' in html. The elements are all nested, like the Russian stacking dolls.
* the href is a hyperlink reference or link.
* Inside of the tags are attributes.
  * Attributes are made up by an attribute name and an attribute value. Below is an example.
    * lang="en-us" prior to the equal sign is the attibute name, the en-us in quotes is the value.

<img is for images, but it requires a source code src-"https://codefellows.com" alt="description of link--so this is codefellows homepage">

1. Introduction: Basically a description of the book, how it is laid out, the thinking/philosophy behind it. Well done actually, it all builds from the structure to design to function *HTML, CSS, JS*
2. HTML Chapter 1: Structure: Hypertext Markup Language. Creates the blueprint/structure for webpages. Uses tags '<html>', '<p>' to create containers or bins in which the content of the webpage sits. The way I think of HTML right now is as the basic outline of the webpage
3. HTML Chapter 8: "Extra Markup" HTML has evolved over the years
    * HTML 4 1997
    * XHTLM 1.0 2000
    * HTML 5 is a current work in progress
    * This is why the !DOCTYPE is so important, to tell browser which HTML is being used. 
    * ID attribute: known as a *global attribute* because it can be used on any element. used for paragraphs, navigation,
    * Class attribute: a way to differentiate elements
    * Block attributes: h1,p, ul are examples
    * Inline attributes: em for emphasis
    * Grouping Text & elements in a block: Div 
    * Grouping Text & elements inline: span
    * iFrames: little window, just like it sounds
    * add comments to code by commenting out with greater than and !
    ID and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements
    DIV and SPAN elements allow you to group
    META tag allows to supply all kinds of info to page
    Escape characters are used to include special characters for copyright symbol for example
