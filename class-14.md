# Team Building by Google

## NYT article on Google's efforts to build perfect team

### What I got out of this:

- Coding and tech in general is much more of a team sport than I ever expected
- The discussion led by John was much more interesting than the article
- These are some universal truths, and I find it a bit arrogant that Google thought they could figure it out. 
- There is no formula for a perfect team, there are principles of how to behave with others. Cooperation and competition are baked into the human experience. 
- My principles are simple: You Matter. You Belong. We need you at your best. Let's get to work.
