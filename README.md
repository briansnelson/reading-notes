## Welcome Brian's First Reading Notes for CodeFellows
My name is Brian Nelson. I've worn many hats in the past 51 years: Retired Soldier, Business Owner (GRIT360), animal rescue co-founder (Kindred Souls Foundation) with my wife, Kelly, of 29 years. Our fundraiser is the coolest race in the history of mankind, Unleashed at Stadium Bowl (unleashedatstadiumbowl.org), which started as Officer PT when I was a battalion commander. My company has four verticals: We build. We connect. We create. We inspire. Each vertical is a separate line of effort. Currently focusing on 'We connect', which is my employment agency for Veterans & Mil Spouses. 

Why code? Why not? Post 911 GI Bill is fantastic, I'm curious, and I can learn this in the evenings. Seems like a no-brainer.
