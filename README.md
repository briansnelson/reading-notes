## Welcome Brian's First Reading Notes for CodeFellows

My name is Brian Nelson. I've worn many hats in the past 51 years:

1. Retired Soldier

2. Business Owner (/GRITlogonew.jpg![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82063641/114231652-8fccac00-992f-11eb-86e8-9f5fec6d0855.png)
3. Animal rescue co-founder (Kindred Souls Foundation) with my wife, Kelly, of 29 years. [Kindred Souls Foundation](https://kindredsoulsfoundation.org)
4. Our fundraiser is the coolest race in the history of mankind, Unleashed at Stadium Bowl [Unleashed at Stadium Bowl](https://unleashedatstadiumbowl.org), which started as Officer PT when I was a battalion commander.

My company has four verticals:

* We build.
* We connect.
* We create.
* We inspire.

Each vertical is a separate line of effort. Currently focusing on 'We connect', which is my employment agency for Veterans & Mil Spouses.

Why code? Why not? Post 911 GI Bill is fantastic, I'm curious, and I can learn this in the evenings. Seems like a no-brainer.

  > *Out of the night that covers me; dark as the pit from pole to pole;
  > I thank whatever God maybe; for my unconquerable soul:
  > In the fell night of circumstance, I have not winced nor cried aloud;
  > Under the bludgeonings of chance; my head is bloody, but unbowed;*
  > **Beyond this place of Wrath and Tears; Looms but the Horror of the Shade;
  > And yet the Menace of the years finds and shall find me Unafraid.
  > It matters not how straight the gate; how charged with punishments the scroll;
  > I am the master of my fate;
  > I am the Captain of my Soul**.
