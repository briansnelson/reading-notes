## Welcome Brian's First Reading Notes for CodeFellows
My name is Brian Nelson. I've worn many hats in the past 51 years: Retired Soldier, Business Owner (GRIT360), animal rescue co-founder (Kindred Souls Foundation) with my wife, Kelly, of 29 years. Our fundraiser is the coolest race in the history of mankind, Unleashed at Stadium Bowl (unleashedatstadiumbowl.org), which started as Officer PT when I was a battalion commander. My company has four verticals: We build. We connect. We create. We inspire. Each vertical is a separate line of effort. Currently focusing on 'We connect', which is my employment agency for Veterans & Mil Spouses. 

Why code? Why not? Post 911 GI Bill is fantastic, I'm curious, and I can learn this in the evenings. Seems like a no-brainer. 

##GROWTH MINDSET: Carol Dweck, PhD in Psychology at UCLA coined this term 15-20 years ago. She has a book called Mindset, interesting but one can undertand the gist by watching her TED talk. According to Dweck, there are two possible mindsets: Fixed Mindset or Growth Mindset. So much interesting information here, but what is frequently misunderstood is that people frequently have different mindsets for different parts of their lives. For example: I can have a growth mindset in athletics--I believe that if I practice free throws, I will improve. Most kids who played any sports in school find this intuitive. IQ, however, frequetnly falls into a fixed mindset for many people. 

In my opinion, this is mostly due to the nature of how we are racked and stacked from Kindergarden through 12th grade about how 'smart' one is. We take tests at intervals, then are put into different levels: general, vocational, academic, gifted...and we stay in these swimlanes for the rest of our academic lives. 

So much to write, but the most important result Dr Dweck found in her studies (IMHO) was how childred responded differently to different types of praise: 
2 groups of children take the same test. Group 1 received this praise, "You did terrific because you are so smart." Group 2 received this praise, "You did terrific because you worked so hard!"

When both groups were asked if they wanted to take the same test, or one that was just a bit harder--the kids who were praised for effort were the only kids who chose the harder test. 

Essentially, never praise your employees, subordinates, children on 'traits'--praise them for their effort. Their grit. Their character. That is what matter. 

## GROWTH MINDSET Reminders:
  1. Frustration is literally the 'feeling of learning'. It isn't easy. If it were easy, you wouldn't improve. 
  2. Remind myself of the times I have learned very difficult things from Russian to installing floors. 
  3. Offer to help others. The best way to get out of one's head is to provide help to others. Changes one's heart and attitude, and then can come back to problems with renewed vigor.
